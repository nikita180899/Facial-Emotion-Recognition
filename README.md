## 1. Description

##### Facial emotion recognition is the process of detecting human emotions from facial expressions. The human brain recognizes emotions automatically, and software has now been developed that can recognize emotions as well. Facial emotion recognition has practical significance, has very broad application prospects, such that user friendly interface between man & machine, humanistic design of goods. Facial emotion recognition improved communication, has better empathy skills, acting with integrity.

### 7. Required Libraries
* numpy : numpy NumPy supports a wide range of hardware and computing platforms, and plays well with distributed, GPU, and sparse array libraries. numpy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
* pandas : pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.
* tensorflow : TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML powered applications.
* keras : Keras is an open-source software library that provides a Python interface for artificial neural networks. Keras acts as an interface for the TensorFlow library. 
* open-cv : OpenCV is a highly optimized library with focus on real-time applications. Cross-Platform C++, Python and Java interfaces support Linux, MacOS, Windows, iOS, and Android.
